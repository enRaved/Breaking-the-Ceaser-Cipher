# Breaking-the-Ceaser-Cipher
The code here contains machine learning code using hidden markov models which breaks the Ceaser cipher

I wrote a hidden markov model from scratch in C which breaks the simple substitution ceaser cipher

The total time of execution is around 3 seconds on an encrypted file of 50000 characters

After all the gamma and digamma passes, the reestimated final matrix B will contains two rows - each row will be either a vowel row or a consonant row.The relative postion of letter 'a' in the first row(which is the vowel row) will represent the shift in key. Use this key to break the cipher 

Accuracy: 100 %
